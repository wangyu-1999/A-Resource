 ##### Multiple Themes

We know that programmers love the dark theme. Toggle between Bright and Dark Theme using the theme button in Navbar.

##### Access To 1 MB Memory

The Emulator supports complete 1 MB Memory, which can be accessed from the memory table.

##### Validated Jump and Call using Labels

As Jumps and calls only allows valid labels, it does not permit any jumps to incorrect position.

##### Selected Interrupts

Being an Emulator, this does not have 'true' memory (See Github Repository) so it supports select few interrupts.

##### Line by Line Execution

Supports running all instructions automatically, or manual line by line execution. You can also stop the automatic execution with a simple button click.

##### Check Registers and Flags in Real Time

Updates Flags and registers along with the execution, so can check the state of Emulator easily, all in a single view.
